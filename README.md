# SudokuChallenge

## Objective
Write an object-oriented program that demonstrates language best practices and
produces a SOLVED sudoku puzzle board such that no board rules are violated:
*No number can repeat in any row, column, or 3x3 subsection of the 9x9 board.*

## Example Output
This is an example completed board:
```
8 9 7 1 6 2 4 5 3
5 1 3 8 7 4 9 6 2
2 4 6 9 3 5 1 8 7
3 6 9 7 8 1 5 2 4
7 5 2 4 9 6 3 1 8
1 8 4 5 2 3 7 9 6
6 7 5 3 1 8 2 4 9
4 3 8 2 5 9 6 7 1
9 2 1 6 4 7 8 3 5
```
Yours can be formatted any way you like: text, HTML, markdown, etc. The objective
is simply to produce a valid board.
  
## Details
Use any object oriented language you feel comfortable with. Create the output in any way you'd like: HTML, command-line output, text file, etc.
